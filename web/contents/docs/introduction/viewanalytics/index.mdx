## Accessing Your Analytics Dashboard

Once you've completed the initial setup, navigate to the **Realtime Analytics** section in the sidebar to visualize your app's analytics through interactive graphs. This dashboard provides insights into your users' behavior, including page views, active sessions, and geographic distribution.

## Key Analytics Features

### 1. **Realtime Tracking**  
Monitor live user activity, including the number of active visitors, pages they are currently viewing, and session durations.

### 2. **Traffic Insights**  
View historical data on user visits, session trends, and referral sources to understand how users discover your platform.

### 3. **Event Tracking**  
Track custom events such as button clicks, form submissions, and conversions. To log an event manually, use the following function:

```tsx showLineNumbers
import { trackEvent } from "supametrics";

trackEvent("button_click", { label: "Signup Button", category: "User Engagement" });
```

### 4. **User Demographics**  
Analyze user demographics like location, device type, and browser to tailor your app's experience for different audiences.

## Exporting Data

SupaMetrics allows you to export your analytics data in CSV or JSON formats. This is useful for in-depth analysis in external tools like Google Sheets or BI platforms.

## Troubleshooting

If you notice discrepancies in your data or missing events:  
- Ensure your **tracking ID** is correctly set up.  
- Check if your domain is allowed in the SupaMetrics settings.  
- Verify that ad blockers or browser settings are not preventing analytics tracking.
