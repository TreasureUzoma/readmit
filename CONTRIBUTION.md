### Submitting Pull Requests

Ready to dive into the code? We welcome pull requests for bug fixes, new features, and improvements.

1.  **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the [Readmit GitHub repository](https://github.com/treasureuzoma/readmit/).
2.  **Clone Your Fork**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/readmit.git
    cd readmit
    ```
3.  **Create a New Branch**: Create a new branch for your changes. Please use a descriptive name (e.g., `feat/add-new-dockerfile-template`, `fix/issue-123-readme-bug`).
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```
4.  **Set Up Development Environment**:
    - Install Go (for the CLI) and Node.js (for the web application/backend). Refer to the `README.md` for specific versions and installation instructions.
    - Install project dependencies: `npm install` in the `web` directory.
5.  **Make Your Changes**: Implement your bug fix or feature.
    - Ensure your code adheres to the project's existing coding style.
    - Add or update tests for your changes if applicable.
    - Update documentation (e.g., `README.md`, `web/contents/docs`) to reflect your changes.
6.  **Lint and Format**: Before committing, ensure your code is properly linted and formatted:
    ```bash
    npm run lint:fix # in the 'web' directory
    npm run format   # in the 'web' directory
    ```
7.  **Commit Your Changes**: We encourage using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for clear and consistent commit messages. The project uses Husky pre-commit hooks to automate search data generation and enforce commit message standards.
    ```bash
    git commit -m "feat: Add a new useful feature"
    # or
    git commit -m "fix(cli): Resolve issue with file reading in the CLI"
    ```
8.  **Push to Your Fork**: Push your changes to your fork on GitHub:
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```
9.  **Open a Pull Request**: Go to the original Readmit repository on GitHub and open a new pull request from your branch.
    - Provide a clear and detailed description of your changes.
    - Reference any related issues (e.g., `Closes #123`).
    - Be responsive to feedback from maintainers.

## Development Setup (for code contributions)

The Readmit project consists of two main parts:

- A **Go CLI** application (`readmit/`).
- A **Next.js web application** that hosts the documentation and the AI generation API (`web/`).

When contributing code, you will primarily be working in one or both of these directories.

## Coding Standards

- **TypeScript/JavaScript**: Follow the ESLint and Prettier configurations found in `web/.eslintrc.json` and `web/.prettierrc`.
- **Go**: Adhere to standard Go formatting practices (`gofmt`).

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the project's MIT License.

Thank you for your interest in Readmit! We look forward to your contributions and working together to build an even better documentation tool.
