## Installation

To get the Readmit web application up and running locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

*   **Node.js**: Version 18.x or higher.
    ```bash
    node -v
    npm -v
    ```
*   **Git**: For cloning the repository.
    ```bash
    git --version
    ```
*   **Code Editor**: Visual Studio Code, WebStorm, or any other preferred text editor.

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/treasureuzoma/readmit.git
    cd readmit
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This command installs all necessary project dependencies, including Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, MDX components, and other development tools like ESLint and Husky.

3.  **Environment Variables**:
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your Supabase and Google GenAI API keys.
    ```env
    GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY=your_google_genai_api_key
    SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
    SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
    ```
    You can obtain these from [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/) and [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).

4.  **Run the Development Server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

5.  **Build for Production** (Optional):
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This command generates a production-ready build of the application.

6.  **Run Production Server** (Optional):
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
    The production application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Readmit serves as a web-based platform and documentation site for an AI-powered documentation generator. Once the application is running, you can:

1.  **Browse Documentation**: Navigate through the comprehensive documentation to understand Readmit's features, setup, and usage. The sidebar provides structured navigation, while the right-hand table of contents allows for quick jumps within pages.
2.  **Use AI Generation (via API)**: The core AI generation logic is exposed via API routes (e.g., `/api/generate`). While this repository provides the web interface, the AI capabilities are designed to be consumed programmatically or through a CLI tool.
    *   **CLI Tool (Conceptual)**: The Readmit product is envisioned to have a CLI tool for direct integration into your development workflow. An example of its usage might look like this:
        ```bash
        # Install the Readmit CLI (if available)
        $ go install github.com/treasureuzoma/readmit/readmit@latest

        # Generate a README for your current project
        $ readmit generate readme
        ```
    *   **Web Interface**: Currently, this repository serves as the platform to host such documentation and provide information about the Readmit product. Future iterations might include a direct web interface for generating documentation.
